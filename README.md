<br>
If uniqueu key is not associated with each component , then react will rerender all the components.
supoose all the component has uniquue key , a new component comes with new id, react will find that it is not present in DOM , so react understand its completely new component, react will not rerender old component , it will only render the new components. Its a huge optimization . Need to explore on this topic more .. 

<br>
 {resObj.map((resturent,index)=>(
                <ResturentCard key={index} resData={resturent}/>
))}
<br>
React does not recommend the index as key .
